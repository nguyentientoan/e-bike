# **Lithium Ion Battery Pack** #
The battery which powers the brushless motor is a 51.8V 15.6Ah Lithium Ion Battery pack. Each individual lithium cell has a nominal voltage of 3.7V and capacity of 1950mAh, this battery has 14 cells of 8 parallel packs (14S8P), 112 total. The lithium cells were taken from recycled laptop battery packs, eight cells were within each pack.

## Battery Specifications ##
  * 51.8V Nominal
  * 15.6 Ah
  * 112 Lithium Ion Cells in 14S8P configuration
  * 10 lbs Net Wgt
  * 1-2C Discharge Rate

## Assembly ##
The laptop battery packs were torn open to recover the lithium cells, the cells were then split up and individually charged to 4.10V. They were monitored over a period of a few hours to see how well they held their charge, this was done for 112 cells. During the charging/testing process, 8 "good" cells were soldered in parallel to create a 4.10V 15.6Ah (1S8P) battery pack. Once 14 1S8P battery packs were created, they were all soldered in series with one another to create a 14S8P battery pack.
The entire process took two weeks and the pack was placed in a protective laptop case to continue on to testing.
