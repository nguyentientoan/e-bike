# **Electric Bike Overview** #
  * Attached a 3-phase brushless motor to the drive train of a standard mountain bike powered by a custom built 51.8V nominal 15.6Ah Lithium Ion battery pack.
  * Bike has reached top speeds of 40mph with an approximate range of 30 miles.
  * Monitoring voltage, current, tire/motor rpm, temperature, and derailleur position on an Android App communicating with an Arduino over Bluetooth.
